# Investment Analysis System Code Analysis

Perform comprehensive code analysis of the investment analysis system with focus on architecture, performance, and investment logic.

## Analysis Areas:

### 1. Investment Logic Validation
- **Signal Generation**: Analyze buy/sell signal accuracy in `quick_analysis.py`
- **Risk Calculations**: Review risk management algorithms in `risk_management.py`
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Examine allocation logic across modules
- **Sentiment Integration**: Validate news/social sentiment weighting

### 2. Performance Analysis
- **API Call Efficiency**: Check for redundant market data requests
- **Caching Strategy**: Analyze `cache_manager.py` effectiveness 
- **Report Generation Speed**: Profile JSON/text output generation
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor data structures in comprehensive analysis

### 3. Architecture Review
- **Module Dependencies**: Map import relationships between analysis tools
- **Configuration Management**: Analyze `config.json` usage patterns
- **Error Handling**: Review exception handling across modules
- **Data Flow**: Trace data pipeline from collection to reporting

### 4. Investment-Specific Metrics
- **Confidence Score Accuracy**: Validate confidence calculation methods
- **Asset Coverage**: Ensure all target stocks/ETFs are properly analyzed
- **Smart Money Tracking**: Review institutional following algorithms
- **Government Contract Detection**: Analyze AI contract identification logic

## Code Quality Checks:

### Security Analysis
- API key handling and storage
- Data sanitization in external API calls
- Configuration file security

### Maintainability
- Code duplication across analysis modules
- Function complexity in comprehensive analyzer
- Documentation coverage for investment algorithms

### Reliability  
- Error handling in market data collection
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Data validation in report generation

## Output Format:
Generate detailed analysis report covering:
1. **Architecture Overview**: Module relationships and data flow
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identified inefficiencies with solutions
3. **Investment Logic Assessment**: Algorithm accuracy and improvements
4. **Technical Debt**: Code quality issues and refactoring recommendations
5. **Security Recommendations**: API and data handling improvements

Focus on maintaining the $900 portfolio analysis accuracy while improving system performance and reliability.
