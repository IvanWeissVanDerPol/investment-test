|------|--------------|-----|----------|
| Test Coverage | Basic smoke tests | No coverage threshold enforcement | HIGH |
| Security Scanning | None | No SAST/dependency scanning | HIGH |
| Multi-Python Testing | 3.11 only | No 3.9-3.12 matrix | MEDIUM |
| Performance Testing | None | No load/benchmark tests | MEDIUM |
| CD Pipeline | Manual deployment | No automated deployment | HIGH |
| Environment Promotion | Manual | No staging→production pipeline | HIGH |
| Rollback Strategy | Manual | No automated rollback | MEDIUM |
