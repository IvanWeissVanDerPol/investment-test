---

## 🧮 **Mathematical Foundation**

### **Kelly Criterion Optimization**
- Calculates optimal position sizes for maximum compound growth
- Uses historical win rates and average returns
- Conservative 50% multiplier for safety (12.9% → 6.5%)

### **Expected Value Analysis**
- 5-scenario framework (bear, down, sideways, up, bull markets)
- Risk-adjusted expected value calculations
- Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR assessments

### **Dynamic Risk Management**
- Performance-based limit adjustments (2x multiplier for excellent performance)
- Cooling periods after losses
- Real-time correlation and volatility monitoring
